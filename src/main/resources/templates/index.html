    <p>Write a Java project to handle operations of an airport. For simplicity, assume that all input data is available
        as JSON, CSV XML files and output data should also be written to a JSON, XML or CSV file. This is an open-ended
        question to see how you will approach the problem from engineering and implementation perspectives.Provide the
        code with clear instructions on how to run it, and a document explaining your design. The code should at least
        be able to parse sample data (you have created) from an input file and write some data to an output file.</p>
